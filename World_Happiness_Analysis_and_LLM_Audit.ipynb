        "\n",
        "This study presents a comprehensive analysis of global happiness patterns using the World Happiness Report dataset (2011–2024). We investigate systematic biases in how large language models (LLMs) perceive and represent happiness across 147 countries with available Gallup data. We combine traditional statistical methods—weighted linear regression for driver analysis, trend analysis, and group comparisons with significance testing, with a novel LLM audit framework employing 20 diverse personas per country evaluated against real 2024 outcomes. Through hyperparameter and prompt-tuning, we identified systematic overestimation in LLM responses and developed four methodological approaches (initial 7-question, few-shot calibration, pure Gallup single-question, and structured-personas single-question) to mitigate bias. Our findings reveal that GDP and social support are the strongest happiness drivers globally, that LLMs exhibit significant overestimation particularly for factor-level metrics due to scale mismatch, and that calibration techniques substantially improve alignment with ground-truth data. This work contributes both to the understanding of global well-being determinants and to the emerging field of AI fairness in subjective well-being representation."

        "\n",
        "Understanding what drives human well-being has long been a central concern for policymakers, researchers, and societies. The World Happiness Report, published annually since 2011, provides a rigorous, data-driven framework for examining life satisfaction across nations using the Gallup World Poll's Cantril Ladder methodology. Beyond its policy relevance, happiness data offers a lens through which to examine economic development, social cohesion, health systems, and governance quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to reason about human experiences and even simulate survey responses, it is critical to examine how accurately and fairly they represent global well-being. Although LLMs can reference objective indicators such as World Happiness scores, their training on vast and uneven text corpora may encode systematic biases toward certain countries, regions, or socioeconomic groups. When these models generate synthetic data or inform social science analyses, such biases can propagate into downstream decisions. Auditing LLM perceptions of happiness by comparing model outputs with empirically collected data therefore serves both methodological and ethical purposes, helping to identify nationality- and income-based distortions and evaluate mitigation strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Our project includes two phases, a traditional analysis of global well-being data and a systematic audit of AI’s perception of happiness, both presented through an interactive dashboard. For the traditional part, we analyze World Happiness Report data (2011–2024) using weighted linear regression, t-tests, and trend analysis to identify key drivers, long-term trends, and group differences, with results visualized across tabs such as World Map, Driver Analysis, Trends, Group Comparisons, and Overview. In parallel, the LLM bias audit compares AI-generated happiness estimates to real-world 2024 outcomes. To ensure reliability before scaling, we conducted prompt tuning (testing baseline, simplified, and scale-reminder variants on a subset of countries and selecting the best based on MAE and correlation) and hyperparameter tuning (e.g., temperature and chain-of-thought) on 10 countries to reduce systematic overestimation. We also developed personas, initially defining 20 diverse profiles per country and later formalizing them into structured fields (nationality, job, gender, living situation, family status, hobbies) to improve reproducibility and maintain a clear nationality focus. Across four approaches—initial 7-question, few-shot calibrated, single-question Gallup-style, and structured personas—we observed a substantial reduction in overestimation bias from roughly 6–10 points to 2–4 points with improved prompting, with all results presented in a dedicated LLM Audit tab.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Bias analysis by group (ANOVA and t-tests vs. real data, with Bonferroni correction where applicable) shows a consistent pattern: overestimation concentrates in less affluent regions, while wealthier regions tend to be underestimated. The Global South, World 2 and 3, Africa, Asia, South Asia, low and lower-middle income countries, and Eastern groups are significantly overestimated, whereas the Global North, World 1 (slightly), North and Latin America, high-income countries, and Western groups are underestimated. At the factor level (GDP, social support, health, freedom, generosity, corruption), strong systematic overestimation appears due to scale mismatch (LLM 0–10 vs. real ~0–2). Across approaches, the most overestimated countries (LLM > real) are typically lower-income or Global South nations (e.g., Botswana, Comoros, Eswatini, Bangladesh, Ghana, Cambodia), while the most underestimated (LLM < real) are generally high-happiness or Western/Nordic countries (e.g., Costa Rica, Finland, Denmark, Canada, Belize, and other Nordic and North American countries), and specifically Israeil."

        "Large-scale measurement of subjective well-being has been institutionalized through the World Happiness Report, which relies on the Cantril Ladder (0–10) as a cognitive life-evaluation instrument derived from the Gallup World Poll [1]. This ladder-based measure has been widely validated and theoretically grounded in broader well-being scholarship, including hedonic and eudaimonic traditions [7,8]. Foundational work by Diener et al. formalized subjective well-being as a measurable construct [9], while subsequent validation studies have examined convergent validity with instruments such as WEMWBS [2] and methodological considerations in cross-national scaling and aggregation [10]. Together, this literature establishes happiness scores as structured, survey-based socio-economic indicators rather than abstract sentiment proxies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**LLM Bias, Synthetic Judgments, and Fairness Governance.**\n",
        "Parallel to advances in well-being measurement, recent research shows that large language models encode subtle and intersectional biases beyond gender, including age, nationality, institutional prestige, and appearance [3]. Broader audits demonstrate risks of stereotyping and representational harms in foundation models [11,12], while studies of algorithmic bias highlight how seemingly neutral systems can reproduce structural inequalities [13]. In response, technical toolkits such as AI Fairness 360 [4] and Fairlearn [6] operationalize group fairness metrics and mitigation strategies, and socio-technical governance frameworks emphasize documentation, stakeholder engagement, and organizational checklists for responsible AI deployment [5,14]. Building on these strands, our work treats LLM-generated happiness assessments as synthetic social data, an artifact that can and should be audited against validated well-being benchmarks and fairness principles.\n"

Trend analysis is conducted to examine yearly changes, measure volatility through standard deviation, and identify the top improving and declining countries. Group comparisons are performed using statistical tests, t-tests for pairwise comparisons and ANOVA for multiple groups, across regions and income levels, with significance determined at p < 0.05 and adjusted using Bonferroni correction. The analysis is implemented using Pandas for data processing and SciPy and Statsmodels for statistical testing.\n"

        "**Driver Analysis:**\n",
        " We conduct a driver analysis using weighted linear regression (StandardScaler + LinearRegression) to rank the relative importance of key factors, GDP, social support, health, freedom, generosity, and corruption, at both global and regional levels, interpreting coefficients and overall model fit (R²) to assess how well these variables explain national variation. Trend analysis examines global and regional evolution from 2011 to 2024 (with narrative focus on 2013–2023) through line plots, volatility measures (standard deviation), and identification of the most improved and declined countries. Group comparisons are further supported by visualizations such as box plots to contrast well-being distributions across different country groups.\n"

The **Initial (7-Question)** method serves as a baseline, revealing significant overestimation and weak correlation with real data. The **Few-Shot (7-Question + Calibration)** approach applies in-context examples to reduce bias. The **Gallup (Single Question)** method simplifies the task by mirroring the established Cantril ladder survey format. Finally, the **Structured Personas (Single Question)** approach uses the same Cantril question but defines personas through structured attributes (e.g., nationality, job, gender) to enhance reproducibility and focus on nationality effects. Overall, the few-shot, single-question, and structured-personas methods outperform the initial baseline, achieving lower MAE, more realistic score distributions, and improved bias mitigation."

        "Our initial LLM audit uses 20 diverse personas spanning ages 18 to 67, occupations ranging from students to retirees, and varied life situations, and surveys them across all countries using seven questions consisting of one overall Cantril Ladder question and six factor specific questions. Each persona is prompted to embody a specific individual living in the target country in 2024. The API client operates with a temperature of 0.0 and a simplified prompt style, selected after systematic hyperparameter and prompt tuning. In terms of configuration, default parameters initially used a temperature of 0.7 but were adjusted to 0.0 after tuning, and outputs are parsed and stored as CSV files. The prompt includes instructions such as “Assume that you are this person living in 2024, and you are from [COUNTRY]”. The full audit covers 2,940 combinations derived from 147 countries and 20 personas, with results saved incrementally to CSV files to ensure reliability and reproducibility.\n"

Using a random sample of 10 countries, we evaluated each configuration against ground truth happiness data based on correlation, mean absolute error, and a combined performance score. The optimal setup used a temperature of 0.0, no chain of thought prompting, and a simplified prompt format. These results guided the design of our initial approach. To ensure reproducibility, the scripts `hyperparameter_tuning.py` and `prompt_tuning.py` located in the `llm_audit_data/` directory can be executed to replicate the experiments, with API outputs automatically stored as timestamped files in `llm_audit_data/results/`.\n"

        "Comparing LLM generated country level averages with real world data revealed consistent overestimation across all metrics. We identified six main causes. First, a scale mismatch, since real factor data reflects regression contributions on a roughly 0 to 1.8 range, while the LLM produces scores on a 0 to 10 scale. Second, an optimism bias in which models tend to default to moderate or positive responses. Third, a lack of calibration due to missing reference points for realistic score distributions. Fourth, confusion between persona and country context, where individual characteristics may be overweighted relative to national conditions. Fifth, factor interpretation issues arising from ambiguous definitions, such as treating social support as binary rather than continuous. Sixth, the absence of negative examples, meaning prompts did not clearly signal that low scores are valid and expected in some contexts. These findings directly motivated the development of our improved few shot and single question approaches.\n"

First, it introduces five real country examples representing different percentiles from top to bottom performers, providing clear anchoring points; their true values are shown purely for calibration purposes and these countries are not included in the evaluation analysis to ensure fairness. Second, it uses percentile framing to contextualize scores, such as describing values around 5 to 6 as part of the global middle range. Third, the prompt emphasizes realism and honesty, references the global average of approximately 5.5, and includes the country name without signaling income level. Fourth, it explicitly validates low scores by providing examples in the 1 to 4 range, making it clear that such responses are legitimate. Fifth, ambiguous factors are clarified using continuous scale descriptions. In terms of configuration, a temperature of 0.3 is used to balance variability and stability, alongside neutral system prompts. Overall, this approach reduces overestimation by roughly one to two points and substantially increases the proportion of low scores, with about 20 to 30 percent falling in the 1 to 4 range.\n",

        "The third approach closely mimics the original Gallup World Poll methodology to ensure conceptual purity and enable a clean baseline comparison. It relies on a single question, the Cantril Ladder, asking respondents to indicate on which step from 0 to 10 they stand, without any factor specific breakdown. The focus is solely on overall life evaluation, and factor columns are set to None to avoid decomposition effects. The prompt includes realistic system instructions, explicit validation of low scores, and clear country context. Using a temperature of 0.3 and an output format compatible with the other approaches, this method tests whether removing factor level questions reduces bias. In practice, it produces lower and more realistic scores than the initial multi question setup, suggesting that minimizing ambiguity and decomposition helps reduce overestimation."

        "The fourth approach retains the same single Cantril Ladder question and Gallup style survey design as the third method, but replaces long narrative persona descriptions with structured persona fields. Rather than presenting a free-text paragraph, each respondent is defined through explicit attributes such as nationality, which is emphasized as the main identity focus, along with gender (added only to this approach after comments in the presentation), age, job, work details, living situation, family context, hobbies, and personal values or notes. The persona pool is fixed and fully reproducible, consisting of 20 personas with balanced gender representation and a shuffled order determined by a fixed random seed. The method reuses the same realistic system prompt and explicit low score validation from the single question Gallup approach, keeps the temperature at 0.3, and outputs a single bracketed number, with factor columns set to None to maintain consistency and methodological clarity.\n"

        "We developed dedicated analysis scripts, including `analyze_llm_vs_real.py` and `analyze_bias.py`, to systematically compare LLM outputs with real world data. The evaluation includes correlation measures such as Pearson and Spearman coefficients, RMSE, and mean and absolute differences, complemented by visualizations like scatter plots and heatmaps. Bias analysis is conducted using grouped t tests and ANOVA with a significance threshold of p less than 0.05, reporting effect sizes such as Cohen’s d and applying Bonferroni corrections for the primary LLM versus real comparisons across multiple groups. Countries are grouped by region, income level, and development status. The results are integrated into a real time dashboard and exported as structured files including `llm_vs_real_comparison.csv`, `bias_summary_*.csv`, and `significant_findings_*.csv`. The full analysis covers all 147 countries with WHR or Gallup data, using 20 personas per country and all four LLM audit approaches.\n"

        "\n",
        "**Data Analysis:**\n",
        "Economic prosperity, particularly GDP, and strong social support systems emerge as the most significant contributors to overall happiness, with robust regression coefficients. A clear gap persists between high and low income regions, highlighting enduring global inequalities in well being. Despite these disparities, the global average happiness score has remained relatively stable over the past decade, suggesting a consistent baseline even amid geopolitical and economic changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**LLM vs. Real Data:**\n",
        "Across all four audit approaches and 147 countries with Gallup data, overall agreement between LLM outputs and World Happiness data is high, with Pearson correlation around 0.82 for life evaluation. However, substantial factor level overestimation persists, as GDP, social support, health, freedom, generosity, and corruption are overpredicted by approximately 3.5 to 6 points on the 0 to 10 scale. While the average country level bias appears small with a mean difference of about +0.05 and mean absolute difference around 0.54, this aggregate view masks structured disparities. LLM scores generally cluster slightly above real values, aligning better with high happiness countries and showing greater variability among lower scoring ones. Personas introduce additional variation, yet systematic country level shifts remain visible across groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Systematic Bias:**\n",
        "Bias patterns are not random but structurally patterned. Overestimation is significantly stronger in the Global South compared to the Global North, with differences remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Low income and World 3 countries exhibit the most pronounced positive bias, whereas underestimation is rare and mostly limited to a few high income regions. Regionally, Africa and parts of Asia show the largest overestimations, and broader East West divides reflect cultural and developmental skews. Development based groupings further confirm that non high income and non developed countries are consistently more overestimated than developed clusters, with ANOVA and Bonferroni corrected t tests indicating that these differences are unlikely to be due to chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Country Level Patterns in the Three Best Approaches:**\n",
        "When focusing on the improved methods, namely the few shot, single question Gallup, and structured persona approaches, a consistent pattern emerges at the extremes. Lower income and Global South countries such as Botswana, Comoros, Eswatini, Bangladesh, Ghana, and Cambodia repeatedly appear among the most overestimated cases. In contrast, high happiness Western and Nordic countries including Costa Rica, Finland, Denmark, Canada, Belize, other Nordic states, Israel, and the State of Palestine are frequently underestimated. This suggests that even after calibration and methodological refinement, LLMs retain an optimistic prior for economically disadvantaged contexts and a more conservative prior for already high performing or contextually complex countries. As a result, real global inequalities are compressed, with poorer countries portrayed as better off than they are and highly satisfied or politically sensitive societies receiving slightly dampened scores. If such synthetic outputs are interpreted as ground truth, they may distort policy insights and fairness evaluations.\n",

        "**Limitations:**\n",
        "This study adopts a specific conceptualization of happiness as life evaluation measured by the Cantril Ladder, which captures cognitive well-being but does not fully reflect emotional or eudaimonic dimensions. The World Happiness Report and Gallup World Poll rely on finite national samples, typically around one thousand respondents with complex sampling weights, and may be affected by non-response, cultural response styles, and measurement noise, and we should acknowledge that it has its own limitations and it is not too reliable as ground truth. The selected explanatory factors such as GDP, social support, health, freedom, generosity, and corruption reflect a largely Western research tradition and may underrepresent other culturally salient drivers like religion, spirituality, or community cohesion. On the LLM side, API stochasticity, especially when temperature is above zero, can produce slight variation across runs; we mitigate this by aggregating across 20 personas per country, though repeated runs or ensembles would provide stronger stability estimates. Persona coverage remains limited, as 20 profiles cannot capture full socio cultural diversity, and some roles may carry implicit stereotypes. Our statistical design involves many group by metric by approach comparisons, so we apply Bonferroni correction to primary LLM versus real tests, which reduces false positives but may obscure weaker true effects. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Future Directions:**\n",
        "Future work should extend beyond cognitive life evaluation by incorporating affective and eudaimonic well-being measures. Persona design can be expanded with more diverse and intersectional identities, alongside systematic comparisons between narrative and fully structured formats. Greater integration of Gallup methodological documentation and margins of error would allow explicit modeling of survey uncertainty. Factor models could be broadened to include culturally specific drivers while avoiding overfitting. Comparative audits across multiple LLM families and the inclusion of reasoning traces would help disentangle numerical bias from content level bias. Repeated runs and ensemble methods could quantify temporal variability in LLM outputs. Ultimately, integrating these auditing tools into policy workflows would enable continuous and longitudinal monitoring of AI bias in well being measurement.\n"

We demonstrated that traditional statistical methods and LLM-based simulation can be combined to both understand global well-being and critically evaluate AI systems. Our four methodological approaches, initial 7-question, few-shot calibration, pure Gallup single-question, and structured-personas single-question, offer a framework for future research on AI fairness in subjective well-being domains."

        "\n",
        "As announced during the seminar, and as Till emailed, this section provides transparency regarding how AI tools were used and reflects critically on their role in the development of our project.\n",
        "\n",
        "### (a) Summary of AI Use\n",
        "\n",
        "AI assistants were used in several capacities. For the brainstorming process, we fully rely on the literature, datasets, avaiable datasets and we rely on the prior work and the suggestions of Ingmar for the methodology and the LLM audit approach we decided to do. For the parts of use of LLMs, first, for code development and debugging, including structuring data pipelines, implementing statistical analyses, and integrating the four LLM audit approaches we used Cursor. Second, for documentation, such as drafting README files, workflow descriptions, and explanatory sections of this notebook we used Cursor and ChatGPT itself. Third, for literature support, suggesting relevant references and helping frame the related work section, we used Perplexity and ChatGPT together to find references, as well as Google Scholar. Finally, Cursor and ChatGPT assisted with notebook organization, structuring the document in a scientific paper format and ensuring that code cells were clearly commented and reproducible, however after that all the explanations, writings and stuff were revised by ourselves, and we added/removed things (since all the LLM writings were not correct).\n",
        "\n",
        "### (b) Critical Reflection\n",
        "\n",
        "**What worked well:**\n",
        "AI assistants significantly accelerated the implementation of repetitive analytical components, particularly bias analysis across multiple groupings and approaches. Cursor helped us a lot for code implementation, and specifically for dashboard creation, and also for the LLM audit part, we thought in a high-level way and it could do most of the concrete tasks in a good way (not perfect, it needed iterations, but that was a fine starting point). Additionally, they supported the generation of clear, academically styled explanations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What did not work well:**\n",
        "The codes generated by Cursor, sometimes did not follow our approach and they were far away from what we thought, as it did not understand our intent well. While, in most of the cases the starting point's generated-code was fine, but it needed a bunch of refinments in many iterations. We started very soon before the Christmas Break, and we did the code implementaion iteratively by the use of LLMs, as it needed refinement a lot. Also, suggested citations and literature references required independent verification, as some of them they did not exist at all (it just invented new citations), or they were irrelevant. But, in my experience asking Perplexity to find relevant links that was the best approach. Also, for notebook writing, Cursor and ChatGPT helped a lot, but they were really inaccurate in such scale of such big file. It needed a lot of refinements, revisions, restructuring sections, and rewriting parts through iterations on the sections one by one, as it was a big file, and they performed poor ont that. In some instances, generated solutions were overly generic and needed adaptation to fit the dataset and analytical design.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What we would do differently:**\n",
        "Sometimes during the iterative development phase and code implementation with the LLMs, we just defined something roughly and asked the LLM to implement it. While, right now, at the end of the day we figure out that it was not a good idea, as the base prompt in code development and the initial draft of the code was really important to be strong and accurate enough to make the life easier in the refinment iterations. Since, in our case when we did it fast and rough idea first, we would spend much more time on refinment. So, in the next projects we may try to make the idea as concrete as possible and with details with a good prompt and do not hand over the process all in the area of decision of the LLM itself. It could save a lot time from us, if we would do it in that manner!\n"
