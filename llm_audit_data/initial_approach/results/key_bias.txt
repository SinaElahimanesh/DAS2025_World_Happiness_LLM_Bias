Key bias findings:
1. Global North vs Global South:
Global South: +1.447 overestimation (109 countries)
Global North: +0.519 overestimation (38 countries)
The LLM overestimates happiness more for Global South countries
2. World 1/2/3 classification:
World 3 (Least Developed): +2.058 overestimation (9 countries)
World 2 (Developing): +1.296 overestimation (116 countries)
World 1 (Highly Developed): +0.389 overestimation (22 countries)
Strong pattern: overestimation increases with lower development levels
3. By continent:
Africa: +1.722 overestimation (highest)
Asia: +1.430 overestimation
Europe: +0.578 overestimation
North America: +0.404 overestimation
Oceania: +0.389 overestimation (lowest)
4. Corruption perception bias:
High Income: +6.524 overestimation
Low Income: +1.960 overestimation
The LLM systematically overestimates corruption perceptions, especially for high-income countries
5. East vs West:
West: +0.529 overestimation
East: +1.159 overestimation
The LLM overestimates more for Eastern countries

Main finding: The LLM systematically overestimates happiness scores, with larger overestimations for less developed countries (World 3, Global South, Africa). This suggests a bias where the model tends to be more optimistic about developing countries' happiness levels compared to real-world data.




New findings: developed country comparisons
1. Developed East Asia vs Developed West:
Developed West: +0.344 overestimation (16 countries: US, Canada, Western Europe, Oceania)
Developed East Asia: +0.776 overestimation (2 countries: Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong)
Developed East Asia is overestimated more than Developed West.
2. Developed country subcategories:
Nordic: +0.132 overestimation (5 countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden) — lowest
Anglo-Saxon: +0.432 overestimation (5 countries: US, UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand)
Central Europe: +0.447 overestimation (6 countries: Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Benelux)
Developed East Asia: +0.776 overestimation (2 countries)
Middle East Developed: +0.378 overestimation (4 countries: Israel, UAE, Qatar, etc.)
3. Economic model/development path:
Social Market (Continental Europe): +0.304 overestimation (9 countries) — lowest
Market Liberal (Anglo-Saxon): +0.432 overestimation (5 countries)
Resource-Based (Oil-rich): +0.706 overestimation (3 countries: UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi, Norway)
State-Led Development (East Asian model): +0.776 overestimation (2 countries: Japan, South Korea, Singapore)
Key insights:
Nordic countries show the smallest bias (+0.132).
Developed East Asia shows higher bias (+0.776) than Developed West (+0.344).
Social Market economies (Continental Europe) show lower bias (+0.304) than Market Liberal (+0.432).
All developed country categories still show overestimation; none show underestimation.
